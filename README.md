Pandas python library,

sklearn connected library



Install required dependencies:

1. Ensure you have SQL Server and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SN24K/Unicorn-Companies-Analysis-Using-SQL-and-SSMS.git
```
3. Change to project directory:
```bash
  cd Unicorn-Companies-Analysis-Using-SQL-and-SSMS
```
4. Load the dataset into your SQL Server instance:
   
   * Open SSMS and connect to your SQL Server instance.
   * Create a new database (e.g., UnicornCompaniesDB).
   * Use the provided SQL script in the data directory to create tables and load data.
